## Essay Questions  

#### 1. Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.

I want to join Ada Developers Academy because I want to create video games. I had taken Java and C++ many many years ago when I was in high school, and I remembered how fun and rewarding it felt to program some code and watch it do something! There was a cause and effect, a task and a reward, and it felt so concrete. Since I was very passionate about playing video games and how much I loved sharing that fandom with others, I knew that I wanted to seek a route creatively with video games, but in my youth I didn’t know exactly how I was going to execute that. I currently work as a video game tester, and started about three years ago. I have several male coworkers who know programming, _but very few women and non-binary folk who do_. I realized that the video game world was _dominated_ by mostly men with toxic masculinity requirements. I want to help break that and open up more doors for those who need it most, by learning programming and hopefully one day teaching it to more people. In order to do this, I need to have the financial stability and flexibility that careers in programming offer.

#### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field?

I’m picturing that within 5 years:  
* I will have created a several successful games and websites.

* I will be living and working in Japan, a country where opportunities for women and non-binary folk in the tech industry are sparse. I want to revolutionize the way of thinking there and create opportunites for people who need it.

#### 3. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

Ada’s vision is very close to my own vision. While I have much to learn, I hope to be able to help others who may never have had the financial privileges to go to college, or even the time to set aside for higher education, because it is also my hope that **_I_** will be helped despite having this kind of sparse educational background. I strongly believe that open-mindedness and embracing diversity is the key to peacefully co-existing with anyone and everyone (and doesn't everyone deserve this as a human being?). It is this belief that inspired me to move from Oklahoma City to Seattle nearly ten years ago. As an Asian-American creative individual, I wanted to be part of a mindset where diversity is embraced and I could also help people feel included and appreciated. 

#### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?

This is an experience of when I worked in retail. Part of our job was to engage in small-talk with customers. A couple came in with their two children; one a toddler, and another, who appeared to be about a 1 year old, who was carefully placed in a stroller. I proceeded to greet them and engage in small talk, when I noticed the mother’s very full belly, and without thinking I excitedly asked when they were expecting again. **It turns out she was not expecting another child**. It was a truly mortifying mistake, and I learned that I should **_NEVER_** mention anything about anyone’s appearance ever again. I do not know what they have been through or are currently experiencing. I would not want someone to say something like that to me if I were in that situation. If I could have, I would have instead engaged in conversation with their adorable children instead of accidentally insulting their mother! I would also have apologized for having said something so rude.
